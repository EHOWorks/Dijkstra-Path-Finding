Little javascript that dynamically solves mazes of custom sizes.

Features : 
- Length/Width Selection
- Can display the logic of the algorithm 
- Displays the cost table for all iterations

To Do : Have to fix a "splash" bug where areas excluded from the solution path gets colored for bigger mazes.
